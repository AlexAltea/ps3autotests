Exploits
========

Information about existing vulnerabilities/exploits for the PlayStation 3. While this database might not be particularly relevant for designing emulators, it could be interesting for PlayStation 3 developers and something to challenge HLE emulators with.

Prefixes:
* `none_`: The exploit relies on an existing application to run the payload.
* `user_`: The exploit requires an userland entry point to run the payload.
* `lv2_`:  The exploit requires a LV2 entry point to run the payload.

Please submit pull requests with more exploit PoC's to complete the collection.
