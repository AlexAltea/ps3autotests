Full VRAM Access
================

## Description
This works on all firmwares up to the last version. This allows you to access the entire 256 MB RSX VRAM range and the entire RSX IO address space. Particularly interesting here, is that this allows to access the last 2 MB of VRAM, reserved only for the LV1 driver, and maybe slightly less interesting, accessing `vsh.self` VRAM area and IO mapped memory.

## Requirements
To launch this exploit, you need either:

* Userland entry point (e.g. WebKit exploit, <= 4.78?)
* NAND console: Patch `ss.param.fself.control` to pass the syscall check.

or:

* LV2 entry point (e.g. exploiting sys_rsx_context_allocate, <= 4.45?): You also need to replace the `sys_rsx_context_attribute` LV2 syscall with the `lv1_gpu_device_map` LV1 hypercall in the source code of this PoC.
